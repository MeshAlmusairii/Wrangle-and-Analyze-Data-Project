# Wrangle-and-Analyze-Data-Project



## Introduction
WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that post about people's pets and score them. Also, it includes a hilarious comment about the dog.
This Twitter account has its own rating system, for example, 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, and so on.

To analyze this accounts data, Udacity academy provided me with three datasets to use it in this project. 
And after cleaning, assessing, and storing the dataset, I used it to visualize some insights that have come 
into my mind. For example, most common dog type, most used twitter source, most common dog names, the correlation between 
favorite and retweet counts, and count of dog rate.
